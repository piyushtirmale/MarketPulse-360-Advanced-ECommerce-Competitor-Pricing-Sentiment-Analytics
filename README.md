# Project Objective

Design and deliver a complete, production-ready analytics system for a retail e-commerce business—covering data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL business questions, and an executive-grade Power BI dashboard—so stakeholders can track growth, pricing power, marketing effectiveness, product/brand performance, and customer sentiment in one place.

# What’s in this project 

**Power BI dashboard (4 pages):** Executive Overview, Product & Brand Analysis, Marketing & Channel Effectiveness, Customer Sentiment & Returns. Each page and visual listed below mirrors the artifacts I produced. 
 
**SQL analysis** answering 43 business questions (enumerated below). 

**Python data preparation + EDA (Jupyter report)**, including cleaning, type fixes, outlier checks (IQR), descriptive stats, and discovery insights.


# Data sources

Four flat files power the model:
**customers.csv** — demographics, registration date, loyalty tier. 

**products.csv** — product master with category, brand, base price, launch date. 

**sales.csv** — daily transactions with units, returns, discount, our vs competitor price, channel. 

**reviews.csv** — product ratings, review dates, and a precomputed sentiment score.



# Process Workflow
1️⃣** Data Generation** (Python – Faker)

Created synthetic yet realistic datasets for customers, products, sales, and reviews.

Ensured unique IDs, valid dates, correct ranges for pricing, discounts, and ratings.

2️⃣ **Data Cleaning** (Python – Pandas)

Handled Missing Values: Replaced "0", blanks, and NULLs with appropriate placeholders.

**Type Normalization:** Converted all date fields (RegistrationDate, LaunchDate, Date, ReviewDate) to datetime.

**Schema Verification:** Checked column presence and datatypes.

**Outlier Detection (IQR):** Flagged anomalies in Revenue, OurPrice, CompetitorPrice, and UnitsSold. (~0.2–0.3% rows flagged).

**Saved Cleaned Datasets:** Exported into a separate folder for SQL & Power BI.

3️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA)

**Descriptive Statistics:** Revenue, discounts, units, ratings, sentiment scores.

**Trend Analysis:** Revenue growth across months, customer acquisition trends.

**Outlier & Anomaly Detection:** Stock-out proxy days (sales=0 after prior demand).

**Launch Analysis:** Products introduced per year and their early reviews.

4️⃣ **SQL Analysis**

Built 43 queries across KPIs, customer analytics, product insights, sentiment, and integrated metrics.

Themes: Revenue KPIs, Demographics, Retention, Brand performance, Channel ROI, Sentiment decay, Loyalty insights.

5️⃣ **Power BI Dashboard** (5 Pages)

**Executive Overview:** KPIs (Revenue, Units, Discounts, Rating), Revenue Trend, Top 10 Products.

**Customer Deep Dive:** Geographical Map , Revenue Trends

**Product & Brand Analysis:** Units vs Revenue, Price vs Sales, Return Rate, Top Brands.

**Marketing & Channel Effectiveness:** Acquisition trends, Revenue per Channel, Customer growth.

**Customer Sentiment & Returns:** Rating distribution, Reviews per month, Sentiment by Brand, Rating decay vs lifecycle.


# Data cleaning  

**Consistent NA handling on load**
Treated "0", 0, and blank strings as missing where appropriate when reading all CSVs to prevent “fake zeros” in demographics and text fields. 
 
**Type normalization (dates)**
Coerced all date fields to datetime: RegistrationDate (customers), LaunchDate (products), Date (sales), and ReviewDate (reviews). This fixed mixed string/date issues and enabled time-series work. 
 
**Schema & missingness inspection**
Verified column presence/types and scanned null patterns across all tables before transformations. 
 
**Outlier detection (IQR)**
Profiled outliers for key numeric fields (e.g., Revenue, UnitsSold, OurPrice, CompetitorPrice) using an IQR fence. Example: OurPrice had ~0.24% flagged rows, CompetitorPrice ~0.23%. These were reviewed (flagged) rather than auto-dropped to preserve signal. 

**Persistence of cleaned outputs**
Wrote the cleaned tables back to a dedicated “Cleaned CSV” folder for modeling and BI. 


###  Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)

A Jupyter Notebook was used for a deeper statistical exploration of the data:

**Descriptives & Distributions:** Analyzed price, discounts, units, ratings, and sentiment to understand central tendency and spread.

**Time Trends:** Investigated trends for revenue, units sold, new customers, and review volume.

**Outlier Analysis:** Explored extreme revenue and price points identified during the cleaning phase.

**Product Lifecycle Analysis:** Analyzed product launch cadence to align rating and return behaviors with product lifecycle timing.


##  Power BI Dashboard Preview

The final output is a 5-page interactive dashboard designed for executive-level analysis.

##  Key Business Insights

The analysis surfaced several high-impact, actionable insights:

-   **Revenue & Market Growth:** Annual revenue crossed **₹30B** with consistent Q3–Q4 spikes, suggesting festive demand drives peak sales. While all loyalty tiers are important, **Gold-tier customers spend more per transaction**.
-   **Geographic Opportunities:** **Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, and Rajasthan** are top revenue states, indicating strong customer adoption in Tier-2 and Tier-3 regions. Urban hubs like Patna and Jaipur are prime locations for targeted regional campaigns.
-   **Product & Brand Performance:** **Beauty & Electronics** dominate in both units sold and revenue. **Brand Gamma** is a clear leader in both sales and customer ratings. Products with high return rates consistently overlap with low ratings, confirming quality issues.
-   **Customer & Loyalty Insights:** An average customer tenure of **18 months** highlights healthy retention. New customer acquisition peaked via **Email Marketing** in 2024–25, and the top 10 spenders contribute disproportionately to revenue, making them a priority for VIP programs.
-   **Pricing & Discounts:** Our prices are generally lower than competitors, especially in Books & Beauty, giving us a pricing edge. In Electronics, competitor prices are more attractive, creating an opportunity to optimize margins.
-   **Marketing & Channels:** The **Organic** channel is best for consistent units sold, while **Email Marketing** is strong for new acquisitions. **Paid ads** are associated with high returns, making it a less profitable channel.
-   **Sentiment & Customer Feedback:** **65% positive sentiment** shows general satisfaction. Negative reviews are concentrated in specific brands, providing early alerts for quality control. Rating decay analysis shows that ratings tend to drop 6–12 months after a product launch, highlighting the need for active product lifecycle management.
